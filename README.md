# DS-Challenge

The programs in this repository are solutions to a programming challenge. In this challenge, you are presented with two 'csv-like' files (inside a text file) which are seperated by an empty space, you can view the text1.txt file in the repository to get a sense of what these files look like. The program must take the file name as input, merge the two csv-like files into one, and order the rows of the data by id. The outfile.txt is an example of what the desired output for text1.txt should look like. 

The first solution, merge_files.py, is a python scipt with no external libraries. The second solution, pd_merge.py, is a more simplified solution which uses Python's Pandas library and performs data manipulation techniques after converting the text file into a pandas data frame.
